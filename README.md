## **Local Development**
This project uses Docker Compose to simplify the setup of dependent services.

### **Starting All Services**
To start both ActiveMQ and MSSQL, run:
```bash
   docker-compose up -d
```

### **Stopping All Services**
To stop all running services, use:
```bash
   docker-compose down
```

## **API Collection**
This project includes a **Bruno Collection** that contains all the APIs for easy testing and exploration.

### **Accessing the Bruno Collection**
- The collection is designed to work with the APIs exposed by this project.
- It includes endpoints for health checks and other application functionalities.

### **How to Use**
1. Download and install the [Bruno API Client](https://www.usebruno.com/).
2. Import the provided Bruno collection from [Docs Directory](docs/SpringBoot%20Learning%20Kit%20-%20APIs) into the client.
3. Use the pre-configured endpoints to test the APIs.

### **Available Endpoints**
- **Health Check**: [http://localhost:8080/management/healthcheck](http://localhost:8080/management/healthcheck)  
  Response: `OK`

Make sure the application and required services (ActiveMQ and MSSQL) are running before testing the APIs.

---

## **Health Check**
The application provides a health check endpoint to verify its status:
- **URL**: [http://localhost:8080/management/healthcheck](http://localhost:8080/management/healthcheck)
- **Response**: `OK`
